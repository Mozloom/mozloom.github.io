    <h1>This is my Final Project for CSC 106 The Joy of Computer Programming. For my final project I attempted to take the popular side scrolling game Flappy Bird and make a spin off of it with my Bitmoji. The objective of the game is to fly my Bitmoji through the sprites using the mouse click for as long as you can. My game has many programming objects such as, variables, functions, arrays, and button object classes. I hope that when you play my game you get as much enjoyment as I did while making it. </h1>
